2. solder pin header first ( just pin header without MCU )
3. Solder 100nf capacitors ( this is optional component )
4. Solder RGB leds if use ( this is optional component )
5. Solder all components that placed in the top of MCU ( make sure no component leave behind )
6. Than go on with other parts
7. If all done double check everything especialy for solder joint
