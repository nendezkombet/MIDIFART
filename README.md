# MIDIFART
Pocket midi controller

MIDIFART is a pocket midi controller designed for Arduino Promini that supports five analog potentiometer, 10 buttons, 1 bank button, some modules and midi output capability via 3.5mm TRS cable for sending data out to hardware synthesizer or midi device, and some modules supported. For programing code can be done with arduinoIDE. The PCB board also support Arduino Promicro as midi device for software controller but sadly you don't have full features like some optional module but it is more than enough for backing up your task.
